# 4-DOF-Robotic-Arm-for-Pick-and-Place-Application
The project involves the design, simulation, and fabrication of a 4-DOF robotic arm capable of autonomous object detection and pick-and-place operations. The robotic arm uses computer vision to detect objects, calculates joint movements through kinematic modeling, and manipulates objects according to a predefined sorting or storage logic.
